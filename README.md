## Description
A simple xkcd password generator created as my Harvard Extension School CSCI 
E-15 P2 project.

## Demo


## Details for teaching team
No login required.

Number of commits on GitHub may seem small. I've accidentally crached my Cmder 
while entering a commit message which created some sort of error that prevented 
push to repository. To solve this I had to do everything from scratch - 
delete P2 folders in my foot, on GH and on DigitalOcean, recreate and reconnect 
them. All commits visible on GH were done after P2 recreation. Older commits can 
be found in "commit_history_and_errors.txt".
